    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      The word "pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the town of Gaeta,
      then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a
      tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze
      ("twelve pizzas") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter
      Sunday. Suggested etymologies include: Byzantine Greek and Late Latin
      pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and Calabrian
      (then Byzantine Italy) pitta,[17] a round flat bread baked in the oven at
      high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can in turn be
      traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή (pikte), "fermented pastry", which in
      Latin became "picta", or Ancient Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic πίττα, pitta),
      "pitch", or πήτεα (pḗtea), "bran" (πητίτης pētítēs, "bran bread"). The
      Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from
      dialectal pinza "clamp", as in modern Italian pinze "pliers, pincers,
      tongs, forceps". Their origin is from Latin pinsere "to pound, stamp".The
      Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo meaning "mouthful" (related to the English
      words "bit" and "bite"), which was brought to Italy in the middle of the
      6th century AD by the invading Lombards. The shift b>p could be explained
      by the High German consonant shift, and it has been noted in this
      connection that in German the word Imbiss means "snack".
    </p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. Records of
      people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be
      found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
      soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great
      baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and
      the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese.
      An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when
      Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find
      peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In
      Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes
      (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread,
      they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by Celaeno. The first
      mention of the word "pizza" comes from a notarial document written in
      Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of "twelve
      pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas
      and a couple of chickens on Easter Day." Modern pizza evolved from similar
      flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.
      Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as
      garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first
      added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was
      sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries. A popular
      contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza Margherita, was
      invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the
      Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in
      honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he
      created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the
      Italian flag — red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella).
      Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although
      later research cast doubt on this legend. An official letter of
      recognition from the Queen's "head of service" remains on display in
      Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.Pizza was taken to the
      United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and
      first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first
      pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Following World War
      II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to
      Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.

    <h2>By region of origin</h2>
    <h3>Italy</h3>
    <p>
      Authentic Neapolitan pizza (pizza napoletana) is made with San Marzano
      tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of Mount Vesuvius, and either
      mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with milk from water buffalo raised in
      the marshlands of Campania and Lazio or Fior-di-latte. Buffalo mozzarella
      is protected with its own European protected designation of origin. Other
      traditional pizzas include pizza alla marinara, which is topped with
      marinara sauce and is supposedly the most ancient tomato-topped
      pizza,pizza capricciosa, which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked
      ham, mushroom, artichoke, and tomato, and pizza pugliese, prepared with
      tomato, mozzarella, and onions. A popular variant of pizza in Italy is
      Sicilian pizza (locally called sfincione or sfinciuni), a thick-crust or
      deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is
      essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and
      other ingredients. Until the 1860s, sfincione was the type of pizza
      usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the
      island.[52] Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of
      Italy, for example pizza al padellino or pizza al tegamino, a small-sized,
      thick-crust, deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont.[
    </p>
    <h3>United States</h3>
    <p>
      The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York City's Little Italy
      in 1905. Common toppings for pizza in the United States include anchovies,
      ground beef, chicken, ham, mushrooms, olives, onions, peppers, pepperoni,
      pineapple, salami, sausage, spinach, steak, and tomatoes. Distinct
      regional types developed in the 20th century, including Buffalo,
      California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek, New Haven, New York, and St. Louis
      styles. These regional variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets,
      turnovers, rolled, and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless
      combinations of sauce and toppings. Thirteen percent of the United States
      population consumes pizza on any given day Pizza chains such as Domino's
      Pizza, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias,
      and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily
      available nationwide.
    </p>
    <h3>Argentina</h3>
    <p>
      Argentina, and more specifically Buenos Aires, saw significant Italian
      immigration at the end of the 19th century. Immigrants from Naples and
      Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though over time Spanish residents came
      to own the majority of the pizza businesses. Standard Argentine pizza has
      a thicker crust, called "media masa" (half dough) than traditional Italian
      style pizza and uses more cheese. In Argentina pizza slices are often
      served topped with fainá, a Genoese chickpea-flour pancake, and
      accompanied by moscato wine. The most popular variety of pizza is called
      "muzzarella" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato
      sauce and cheese) but made with a thicker "media masa" crust, triple
      cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives. It can be found in
      nearly every corner of the country; Buenos Aires is considered the city
      with the most pizza bars per person of the world.[60] Other popular
      varieties include ham, tomato slices, red pepper and longaniza. Two
      Argentine-originated varieties of pizza with onion, are also very popular:
      fugazza with cheese, a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions,
      and fugazzetta, with the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on
      top.
    </p>
    <h2>Preparation Process</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices.
      Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the
      sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be
      frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with
      raw ingredients and self-rising crusts. Another form of pizza is available
      from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then
      sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores
      sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at
      home before baking in an oven.

    <h3>Baking</h3>
    <p>
      In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the
      heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in
      traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pizza is slid
      into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot
      bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever
      the oven surface is. Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with
      cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it. When made at
      home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce
      some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal
      surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it. Some
      home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in
      restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for
      centuries, in order to achieve even heat distribution. Another variation
      is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue
      grill. Greek pizza, like deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is
      baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven. Most
      restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to
      assemble their pizzas. Mass production of pizza by chains can be
      completely automated.

    />
    <h3>Crust</h3>
    <p>
      The bottom of the pizza, called the "crust", may vary widely according to
      style – thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a
      deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be
      seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of
      the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione. Some pizza dough
      contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the
      crust.Dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza
      chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when
      eating pizza, especially the crust.

    <h3>Cheese</h3>
    <p>
      Mozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella
      produced in the surroundings of Naples.[43] Other cheeses are also used,
      particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano,
      ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese
      analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable
      qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and
      moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal
      and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments
      analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture
      processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In
      1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 1
      million metric tons (1,100,000 short tons) in the U.S. and 100,000 metric
      tons (110,000 short tons) in Europe.
