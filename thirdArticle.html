    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Fashion is a form of self-expression and autonomy at a particular period
      and place and in a specific context, of clothing, footwear, lifestyle,
      accessories, makeup, hairstyle, and body posture. The term implies a look
      defined by the fashion industry as that which is trending. Everything that
      is considered fashionis available and popularized by the fashion system
      (industry and media).

  <h2>History of fashion</h2>
  <p>
    Changes in clothing often took place at times of economic or social change,
    as occurred in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate, followed by a long
    period without significant changes. In eighth-century Moorish Spain, the
    musician Ziryab introduced to Córdoba sophisticated clothing styles based on
    seasonal and daily fashions from his native Baghdad, modified by his
    inspiration. Similar changes in fashion occurred in the 11th century in the
    Middle East following the arrival of the Turks, who introduced clothing
    styles from Central Asia and the Far East.

  <h2>Public relations and social media</h2>
  <p>
    Fashion public relations involves being in touch with a company's audiences
    and creating strong relationships with them, reaching out to media, and
    initiatingmessages that project positive images of the company. Social media
    plays an important role in modern-day fashion public relations; enabling
    practitionersto reach a wide range of consumers through various platforms.
    Building brand awareness and credibility is a key implication of good public
    relations. In some cases, the hype is built about new designers' collections
    before they are released into the market, due to the immense exposure
    generated by practitioners.Social media, such as blogs, microblogs,
    podcasts, photo and video sharing sites have all become increasingly
    important to fashion public relations.The interactive nature of these
    platforms allows practitioners to engage and communicate with the public in
    real-time, and tailor their clients' brand or campaign messages to the
    target audience. With blogging platforms such as Instagram, Tumblr,
    WordPress, Squarespace, and other sharing sites, bloggers have emerged as
    expert fashion commentators, shaping brands and having a great impact on
    what is ‘on trend’. Women in the fashion public relations industry such as
    Sweaty Betty PR founder Roxy Jacenko and Oscar de la Renta's PR girl Erika
    Bearman, have acquired copious followers on their social media sites, by
    providing a brand identity and a behind the scenes look into the companies
    they work for. Social media is changing the way practitioners deliver
    messages,as they are concerned with the media, and also customer
    relationship building. PR practitioners must provide effective communication
    among all platforms, in order to engage the fashion public in anindustry
    socially connected via online shopping. Consumers have the ability to sh
    (such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.), and if practitioners deliver
    the brand message effectively and meet the needs of its public,
    word-of-mouth publicity will be generated and potentially provide a wide
    reach for the designer and their products.

  <h2>Fashion and political activism</h2>
  <p>
    As fashion concerns people, and signifies social hierarchies, fashion
    intersects with politics and the social organization of societies. Whereas
    haute couture and business suits are associated by people in power, also
    groups aiming to challenge the political order also use clothes to signal
    their position. The explicit use of fashion as a form of activism, is
    usually referred to as "fashion activism." There is a complex relationship
    between fashion and feminism. Some feminists have argued that by
    participating in feminine fashions women are contributing to maintaining the
    gender differences which are part of women's oppression. Brownmiller felt
    that women should reject traditionally feminine dress, focusing on comfort
    and practicality rather than fashion. Others believe that it is the fashion
    system itself that is repressive in requiring women to seasonally change
    their clothes to keep up with trends.Greer has advocated this argument that
    seasonal changes in dress should be ignored; she argues that women can be
    liberated by replacing the compulsiveness of fashion with enjoyment of
    rejecting the norm to create their own personal styling. This rejection of
    seasonal fashion led to many protests in the 1960s alongside rejection of
    fashion on socialist, racial and environmental grounds. However, Mosmann has
    pointed out that the relationship between protesting fashion and creating
    fashion is dynamic because the language and style used in these protests has
    then become part of fashion itself. Fashion designers and brands have
    traditionally kept themselves out of political conflicts, there has been a
    movement in the industry towards taking more explicit positions across the
    political spectrum. From maintaining a rather apolitical stance, designers
    and brands today engage more explicitly in current debates. For example,
    considering the U.S.'s political climate in the surrounding months of the
    2016 presidential election, during 2017 fashion weeks in London, Milan, New
    York, Paris and São Paulo amongst others, many designers took the
    opportunity to take political stances leveraging their platforms and
    influence to reach their customers.This has also led to some controversy
    over democratic values, as fashion is not always the most inclusive platform
    for political debate, but a one-way broadcast of top-down messages. When
    taking an explicit political stance, designers generally favor issues that
    can be identified in clear language with virtuous undertones. For example,
    aiming to "amplify a greater message of unity, inclusion, diversity, and
    feminism in a fashion space", designer Mara Hoffman invited the founders of
    the Women's March on Washington to open her show which featured modern
    silhouettes of utilitarian wear, described by critics as "Made for a modern
    warrior" and "Clothing for those who still have work to do". Prabal Gurung
    debuted his collection of T-shirts featuring slogans such as "The Future is
    Female", "We Will Not Be Silenced", and "Nevertheless She Persisted", with
    proceeds going to the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and Gurung's own charity,
    "Shikshya Foundation Nepal". Similarly, The Business of Fashion launched the
    #TiedTogether movement on Social Media, encouraging member of the industry
    from editors to models, to wear a white bandana advocating for "unity,
    solidarity, and inclusiveness during fashion week".Fashion may be used to
    promote a cause, such as to promote healthy behavior, to raise money for a
    cancer cure,or to raise money for local charities such as the Juvenile
    Protective Association or a children's hospice. One fashion cause is
    trashion, which is using trash to make clothes, jewelry, and other fashion
    items in order to promote awareness of pollution. There are a number of
    modern trashion artists such as Marina DeBris, Ann Wizer,and Nancy Judd.
    Other designers have used DIY fashions, in the tradition of the punk
    movement, to address elitism in the industry to promote more inclusion and
    diversity.

  <h2>Anthropological perspective</h2>
  <p>
    From an academic lens, the sporting of various fashions has been seen as a
    form of fashion language, a mode of communication that produced various
    fashion statements, using a grammar of fashion. This is a perspective
    promoted in the work of influential French philosopher and semiotician
    Roland Barthes. Anthropology, the study of culture and of human societies,
    examines fashion by asking why certain styles are deemed socially
    appropriate and others are not. From the theory of interactionism, a certain
    practice or expression is chosen by those in power in a community, and that
    becomes "the fashion" as defined at a certain time by the people under
    influence of those in power. If a particular style has a meaning in an
    already occurring set of beliefs, then that style may have a greater chance
    of become fashion. According to cultural theorists Ted Polhemus and Lynn
    Procter, one can describe fashion as adornment, of which there are two
    types: fashion and anti-fashion. Through the capitalization and
    commoditization of clothing, accessories, and shoes, etc., what once
    constituted anti-fashion becomes part of fashion as the lines between
    fashion and anti-fashion are blurred, as expressions that were once outside
    the changes of fashion are swept along with trends to signify new
    meanings.Examples range from how elements from ethnic dress becomes part of
    a trend and appear on catwalks or street cultures, for example how tattoos
    travel from sailors, laborers and criminals to popular culture. To cultural
    theorist Malcolm Bernard, fashion and anti-fashion differ as polar
    opposites. Anti-fashion is fixed and changes little over time, varying
    depending on the cultural or social group one is associated with or where
    one lives, but within that group or locality the style changes little.
    Fashion, in contrast, can change (evolve) very quickly and is not affiliated
    with one group or area of the world but spreads throughout the world
    wherever people can communicate easily with each other. An example of
    anti-fashion would be ceremonial or otherwise traditional clothing where
    specific garments and their designs are both reproduced faithfully and with
    the intent of maintaining a status quo of tradition. This can be seen in the
    clothing of some kabuki plays, where some character outfits are kept intact
    from designs of several centuries ago, in some cases retaining the crests of
    the actors considered to have 'perfected' that role. Anti-fashion is
    concerned with maintaining the status quo, while fashion is concerned with
    social mobility. Time is expressed in terms of continuity in anti-fashion,
    and in terms of change in fashion; fashion has changing modes of adornment,
    while anti-fashion has fixed modes of adornment. From this theoretical lens,
    change in fashion is part of the larger industrial system and is structured
    by the powerful actors in this system to be a deliberate change in style,
    promoted through the channels influenced by the industry (such as paid
    advertisements).

  <h2>Fashion trends</h2>
  <p>
    A fashion trend signifies a specific look or expression that is spread
    across a population at a specific time and place. A trend is considered a
    more ephemeral look, not defined by the seasons when collections are
    released by the fashion industry. A trend can thus emerge from street style,
    across cultures, and from influencers and other celebrities. Fashion trends
    are influenced by several factors, including cinema, celebrities, climate,
    creative explorations, innovations, designs, political, economic, social,
    and technological. Examining these factors is called a PEST analysis.
    Fashion forecasters can use this information to help determine the growth or
    decline of a particular trend.
  </p>
  <h3>Social influences</h3>
  <p>
    Fashion is inherently a social phenomenon. A person cannot have a fashion by
    oneself, but for something to be defined as fashion, there needs to be
    dissemination and followers. This dissemination can take several forms; from
    the top-down ("trickle-down") to bottom-up ("bubble up/trickle-up"), or
    transversally across cultures and through viral memes and media
    ("trickle-across"). Fashion relates to the social and cultural context of an
    environment. According to Matika, "Elements of popular culture become fused
    when a person's trend is associated with a preference for a genre of music
    […] like music, news, or literature, fashion has been fused into everyday
    lives." Fashion is not only seen as purely aesthetic; fashion is also a
    medium for people to create an overall effect and express their opinions and
    overall art. This mirrors what performers frequently accomplish through
    music videos. In the music video 'Formation' by Beyoncé, according to
    Carlos, The annual or seasonal runway show is a reflection of fashion trends
    and a designer's inspirations. For designers like Vivienne Westwood, runway
    shows are a platform for her voice on politics and current events. For her
    AW15 menswear show, according to Water,"where models with severely bruised
    faces channeled eco-warriors on a mission to save the planet." Another
    recent example is a staged feminist protest march for Chanel's SS15 show,
    rioting models chanting words of empowerment using signs like "Feminist but
    feminine" and "Ladies first." According to Water, "The show tapped into
    Chanel's long history of championing female independence: founder Coco
    Chanel was a trailblazer for liberating the female body in the post-WWI era,
    introducing silhouettes that countered the restrictive corsets then in
    favour." The annual Met Gala ceremony in Manhattan is a venue where fashion
    designers and their creations are celebrated. Social media is also a place
    where fashion is presented most often. Some influencers are paid huge
    amounts of money to promote a product or clothing item, where the business
    hopes many viewers will buy the product off the back of the advertisement.
    Instagram is the most popular platform for advertising, but Facebook,
    Snapchat, Twitter and other platforms are also used.[42] In New York, the
    LGBT fashion design community contributes very significantly to promulgating
    fashion trends, and drag celebrities have developed a profound influence
    upon New York Fashion Week.

  <h3>Market research</h3>
  <p>
    Consumers of different groups have varying needs and demands. Factors taken
    into consideration when analyzing consumers' needs include key
    demographics.To understand consumers' needs and predict fashion trends,
    fashion companies have to do market research There are two research methods:
    primary and secondary. Secondary methods are taking other information that
    has already been collected, for example using a book or an article for
    research. Primary research is collecting data through surveys, interviews,
    observation, and/or focus groups. Primary research often focuses on large
    sample sizes to determine customer's motivations to shop.[48] The benefits
    of primary research are specific information about a fashion brand's
    consumer is explored. Surveys are helpful tools; questions can be open-ended
    or closed-ended. Negative factor surveys and interviews present is that the
    answers can be biased, due to wording in the survey or on face-to-face
    interactions. Focus groups, about 8 to 12 people, can be beneficial because
    several points can be addressed in depth. However, there are drawbacks to
    this tactic, too. With such a small sample size, it is hard to know if the
    greater public would react the same way as the focus group.[47] Observation
    can really help a company gain insight on what a consumer truly wants. There
    is less of a bias because consumers are just performing their daily tasks,
    not necessarily realizing they are being observed. For example, observing
    the public by taking street style photos of people, the consumer did not get
    dressed in the morning knowing that would have their photo taken
    necessarily. They just wear what they would normally wear. Through
    observation patterns can be seen, helping trend forecasters know what their
    target market needs and wants. Knowing the needs of consumers will increase
    fashion companies' sales and profits. Through research and studying the
    consumers' lives the needs of the customer can be obtained and help fashion
    brands know what trends the consumers are ready for.
